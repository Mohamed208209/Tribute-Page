      Abdul Sattar Edhi was a legendary Pakistani philanthropist and humanitarian who founded
       the Edhi Foundation which operates hospitals, orphanages, homeless shelters and rehab
        centers all over Pakistan. One of the country’s most respected figures, he is known as 
        “Angel of Mercy” for his selfless service to the abandoned, sick, destitute and the ostracized.
         He was helped in his life’s work by his wife, Bilquis Edhi, a nurse committed to the same 
         humanitarian values as her husband. Born in India in the late 1920s, he was raised to be 
         compassionate towards the less privileged. He spent his teenage years caring for his paralyzed 
         and mentally ill mother which furthered his passion to do something for the sick.
          Forced to move to Pakistan as a young man after the partition of India, he witnessed the 
          horrors of war and the massive human sufferings that followed. Moved by the widespread 
          pain and misery around him, he set about laying the foundations for what would one 
          day become the Edhi Foundation. Having begun his charitable work singlehandedly, he soon met 
          some kindred spirits who helped him in establishing hospitals and orphanages across the 
          nation. An austere and open-minded individual, he promoted religious tolerance and advocated 
          for the rights of women to work outside their homes.
